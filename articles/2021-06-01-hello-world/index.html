      <p>
        Hey, my name is Aiden Shi and I'm a high schooler with an intrest in programming. I've been programming since I
        was 7 (If you count html as a language and not markup).
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is for all my thoughts, from education to programming. All thoughts are my own.

      <h2 id="website" class="section-heading"><a href="#website">What is this website built with?</a></h2>
      <p>
        This website is purely built with html and css. No trackers, no cookies stored. The website does
        use a bit of templating, but thats just used to make creating new articles easier, you can find all the source
        code <a href="https://github.com/vooxal/blog">here</a>. The color scheme comes from <a
          href="https://www.nordtheme.com/">Nord</a>. Fonts are <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/dm-mono">DM
          Mono</a> for the headings and <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/RobotoMono">Roboto Mono</a> for text.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want, you can get the data of any article by requesting the <a href="data.json">data.json</a>. This will
        contain all the data you will need, including all the text, split into sections, then into paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, the website is designed for only computer view and not might look as good on other devices.
